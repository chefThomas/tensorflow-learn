# Chapter 1: What is AI

## What is Intelligence?

- intelligence was outside the realm of mechanical structures until advent of computers.
- 1950s: AI term coined
- `AI`: imitation of human activities that we believe requires intelligence, regardless of sophistication. Even losing tic-tac-toe algorithm can be called AI

## History of AI

- Previously AI at a high-level was a collection of if-then statements
- Machine Learning (ML): an application trained according to data fed to it
- `von Neuman bottleneck`
  - limitation on data flow from memory to CPU imposed by traditional computer architecture.
  - 2000s: overcome by graphics processing units (GPU)
- ML jumped from academia to reality with one of the first ML milestones: `image recognition`, specifically, reading handwritten digits.
  - Hinton used ML` deep neural networks`

## `Neural Networks`

- digital `nodes` (aka `perceptron networks`) simulate neurons
  - activate like synapses
- Vastly layered connectioned of nodes --> `deep learning`
- AI is the super set
  - Machine Learning
    - Deep learning
- Training `iterations` are used to build out neurons based on data --> predictive power increases i.e. the model learns
- We learn through electrical signals induced by stimuli. In ML, the analog is `tensor`.
